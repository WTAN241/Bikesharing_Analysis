# Bikesharing_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to use actual data from Citi Bike in New York to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. Although it is important to recognize that Des Moines and New York are different cities, this analysis will find out which data will and will not apply to Des Moines.

## Results

### Checkout Times for Users
[Checkout Times for Users](https://public.tableau.com/profile/wenyi.tan#!/vizhome/CheckoutTimesforUsers_16217475266230/CheckoutTimesforUsers)

The graph of checkout times for users will provide data on the turnaround of bikes which would help in determining the amount of bikes needed at different periods of time. According to this graph, the highest number of bikes being rented have a tripduration of 5 minutes. Most of the trips concentrate in the range of 1-30 minutes. Trips that are longer than one hour, have on average a count of less than 1,000. Therefore, we can conclude that most of the trips are short periods and are less than 30 minutes long. 

### Checkout Times by Gender

The graph of checkout times by gender will provide data to better understand the customer demographic. According to this graph, male customers rent Citi bikes about 3.1x more than female customers. The highest number of bikes rented were for a tripduration of about 5 minutes and there were respectively 108,087 males, 33,041 females and 5,624 unknown registrations that rented those bikes. With that being said, it would be important to gather data on the gender demographic in Des Moines since bikesharing is most heavily used among males.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour
[Trips by Weekday per Hour](https://public.tableau.com/profile/wenyi.tan#!/vizhome/TripsbyWeekdayperHour_16217481594090/TripsbyWeekdayperHour)

The graph of trips by weekday per hour will provide data to better understand the times with the highest demand during the week. According to this graph, bikes experience the highest demands from Monday through Friday at around 8AM-9AM and 5PM-7OM. These time frames are consistent with when most customers get out of work. Therefore, it would be important to provide sufficient bikes during these time frames and allocate them close to office areas.
