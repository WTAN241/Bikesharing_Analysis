# Bikesharing_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to use actual data from Citi Bike in New York to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. Although it is important to recognize that Des Moines and New York are different cities, this analysis will find out which data will and will not apply to Des Moines.

## Results

### Checkout Times for Users

The graph of checkout times for users will provide data on the turnaround of bikes which would help in determining the amount of bikes needed at different periods of time. According to this graph, the highest number of bikes being rented have a tripduration of 5 minutes. Most of the trips concentrate in the range of 1-30 minutes. Trips that are longer than one hour, have on average a count of less than 1,000. Therefore, we can conclude that most of the trips are short periods and are less than 30 minutes long. 

### Checkout Times by Gender

The graph of checkout times by gender will provide data to better understand the customer demographic. According to this graph, male customers rent Citi bikes about 3.1x more than female customers. The highest number of bikes rented were for a tripduration of about 5 minutes and there were respectively 108,087 males, 33,041 females and 5,624 unknown registrations that rented those bikes. With that being said, it would be important to gather data on the gender demographic in Des Moines since bikesharing is most heavily used among males.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

![Trips by Weekday per Hour](https://github.com/WTAN241/Bikesharing_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/trips_by_weekday_per_hour.PNG)
The graph of trips by weekday per hour will provide data to better understand the times with the highest demand during the week. According to this graph, bikes experience the highest demands from Monday through Friday at around 8AM-9AM and 5PM-7OM. These time frames are consistent with when most customers get out of work. Therefore, it would be important to provide sufficient bikes during these time frames and allocate them close to office areas.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

The graph of trips by gender by weekday per hour will provide data to better understand the times with the highest demand during the week and their respective gender demographic allocation. This graph dives deeper than the previous graph because it provides more data on the gender demographic allocation. The time frames for bike demands are consistent with the previous chart. Nevertheless, the current chart shows that there are more male than female users for bikesharing. Data on gender demographic in the workplace in Des Moines would prove to be helpful in determing whether the demand would be high.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

![User Trips by Gender by Weekday](https://github.com/WTAN241/Bikesharing_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/user_trips_by_gender_by_weekday.PNG)
The graph of user trips by gender by weekday will provide data to better understand the user types (either subscriber or non-subscriber), the gender demographic and the weekday demands. This graph dives even deeper than the previous two graphs because it provides more data on the user type which will help understand whether many of these users are short-term users or long-term. According to the graph, the bike-sharing demand is relatively similar across the different days of the week and the different genders. On the other hand, the demand for within the subscribers users type is concentrated in male users and during Thursdays and Fridays.

### Average Trip Duration by Age

![Average Trip Duration by Age](https://github.com/WTAN241/Bikesharing_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/average_trip_duration_by_age.PNG)
The graph of average trip duration by age will provide data to better understand the age demographic and trip duration for the bike sharing users. According to the graph, the bike-sharing demand is more concentrated in the younger generation (ages 18-27), who have an average trip duration of about 16 minutes. Nevertheless, the data shows a spike in users with age around 50 years and have a average trip duration of approximately 30 minutes which may be due to users who are retired and rent the bikes for sightseeing trips. Therefore, it is important to collect data on Des Moines age demographic to understand whether they have the specific age group to fulfill the demand for bikes.

### Customer Type

The graph of customer type shows the composition of bike sharing users by trip count. According to the graph, the bike-sharing demand is more concentrated in the subscription user type with a proportion of around 81%. Therefore, it is concluded that most of the revenue generated by bike sharing comes from the subscription type of user.
